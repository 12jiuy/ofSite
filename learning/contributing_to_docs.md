The documentation is written by users like you that enjoy OF.

### Did you find some incorrect information?

If you are not sure, ask in the forum first. If you want to correct the documentation, fork the repository, create a separate branch and open a pull request. If you are not familiar with git, let some friend help you

### Do you want to contribute to the actual documentation?

That is great!
These are some of the things that we could improve:

* Add a Readme file for each example in the `examples` folder, like in this [example](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/3d/ofNodeExample)
* Fill the modules documentation. All the modules have its documentation, accessible by clicking on "Module Documentation" on the [documentation page](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation). If you feel that something important is missing, or it is not well explained, open a pull request on the [openFrameworks website repository](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofSite).
* Fill classes documentation in the `documentation` folder on the [openFrameworks website repository](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofSite/tree/master/documentation) 
* Fill function documentation in the source code of the openFrameworks repository.
