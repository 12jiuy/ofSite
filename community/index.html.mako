To get more involved in OF, check out the developers mailing list <a href="http://dev.openframeworks.cc/listinfo.cgi/of-dev-openframeworks.cc">of-dev</a>. While the forum is ideal for asking questions and sharing projects, the dev list is a great place for discussion about the direction OF is heading. The list is open to everyone, and we like to foster a diverse crowd to help OF become as useful and interesting as possible!

openFrameworks is actively developed by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/), [Theodore Watson](http://muonics.net/), and [Arturo Castro](http://arturocastro.net/) ("the core"), with help from the [OF community](../community/). openFrameworks is indebted to two significant precursors: the [Processing development environment](http://processing.org/), created by [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/), [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/) and the Processing community; and the ACU Toolkit, a privately distributed C++ library developed by Ben Fry and others in the [MIT Media Lab's Aesthetics and Computation Group](http://acg.media.mit.edu/). A number of community leaders maintain responsibility for subsections of openFrameworks on a rotating basis, currently:
